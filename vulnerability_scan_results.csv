Cross-site scripting (XSS): XSS vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to theft of user data, account takeover, and other malicious activities. To mitigate XSS vulnerabilities, you can:

    Sanitize user inputs to remove any malicious scripts
    Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources of scripts and other active content
    Use HTTP-only cookies to prevent scripts from accessing session cookies
        Keep web applications and plugins up-to-date
    Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter out XSS attacks

SQL injection: SQL injection vulnerabilities allow attackers to inject malicious SQL code into web applications that use SQL databases. This can lead to data theft, data corruption, and other malicious activities. To mitigate SQL injection vulnerabilities, you can:

    Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate data from SQL code
    Use input validation to restrict user inputs to expected values
    Use stored procedures to limit the surface of attack
    Keep web applications and databases up-to-date
    Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter out SQL injection attacks

Remote file inclusion (RFI): RFI vulnerabilities allow attackers to include remote files in web applications, which can lead to code execution, data theft, and other malicious activities. To mitigate RFI vulnerabilities, you can:

    Disable remote file inclusion by disallowing external URLs in file inclusion functions
    Use input validation to restrict user inputs to expected values
    Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter out RFI attacks
    Keep web applications up-to-date

Local file inclusion (LFI): LFI vulnerabilities allow attackers to include local files in web applications, which can lead to data theft, data corruption, and other malicious activities. To mitigate LFI vulnerabilities, you can:

    Disable file inclusion by using alternative methods to access files
    Use input validation to restrict user inputs to expected values
    Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter out LFI attacks
    Keep web applications up-to-date
Command injection: Command injection vulnerabilities allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the web server, which can lead to code execution, data theft, and other malicious activities. To mitigate command injection vulnerabilities, you can:

    Use input validation to restrict user inputs to expected values
    Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter out command injection attacks
        Keep web applications up-to-date
    Use least privilege principles to limit the impact of command injection attacks

Insecure direct object references (IDOR): IDOR vulnerabilities allow attackers to access or modify objects that belong to other users, which can lead to data theft, data corruption, and other malicious activities. To mitigate IDOR vulnerabilities, you can:

    Use access control mechanisms to restrict access to objects based on user roles and permissions
    Use input validation to restrict user inputs to expected values
    Use a web application firewall (WAF) to filter out IDOR attacks
    Keep web applications up-to-date
